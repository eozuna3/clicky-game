# Mongo-Scraper 

### Overview
This application uses React to create a website that allows the user to version of a memory game using pictures of viruses from the CDC.  The website will display a total of 12 images of viruses.  The user is then allowed to click on one of the virus images.  When they do, it increases the current score of the user and also the top score if the current score is greater than the top score.  After clicking on an image, the website will redisplay a new random pattern of the previous 12 images.  The user can then choose another image and click on that image.  If they choose an image that has already been selected, they will be notified, and their current score will be reset to zero.  The website will again randomly shuffle the images on the screen.  I was the sole creator of this website.
